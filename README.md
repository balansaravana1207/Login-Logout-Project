Login and Logout Module using Java Servlets and JSP

A foundational web application project demonstrating a secure user authentication and session management system using Java Servlets and JSP.

Description

This project provides a straightforward yet robust implementation of a login and logout module. It is designed to serve as a starting point or a learning resource for building secure web applications in Java EE. The module handles user credential validation, session creation and invalidation, and redirection between public and protected pages.

Features

User Authentication: Validates user credentials (username and password) against hardcoded values.

Session Management: Creates a user session (HttpSession) upon successful login and destroys it upon logout.

Protected Resources: A welcome page that is only accessible to authenticated users.

Clear User Feedback: Provides appropriate success and error messages to the user.

Simple and Clean Code: Easy to understand and extend for more complex applications (e.g., database integration).

Technology Stack

Backend: Java Servlets API

Frontend: JavaServer Pages (JSP) & HTML

Server: Apache Tomcat (or any other Java servlet container like Jetty or GlassFish)

Build Tool: Apache Maven or Gradle (optional, can be run directly from an IDE)

IDE: Eclipse for Java EE Developers (or IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans)

Setup and Usage

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

Prerequisites

Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or higher.

IDE: An IDE that supports Java EE projects, such as Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers.

Web Server: Apache Tomcat 8 or 9.

Running the Application

Clone the repository:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
git clone https://github.com/balansaravana1207/Login-Logout-Project.git
```2.  **Import the project into your IDE:**
-   In Eclipse, select `File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace`.
-   Select the cloned repository folder as the root directory.

Configure the server:

Add your Apache Tomcat server to the IDE's "Servers" view.

Right-click the project and select Run As -> Run on Server.

Choose your configured Tomcat server.

Access the application:

The application will be deployed, and your web browser will open to the login page:

URL: http://localhost:8080/Login-Logout-Project/

How to Use

To log in:

Username: user

Password: password

To see the failure case:

Enter any other credentials.

Project Structure

The project follows the standard directory structure for a Dynamic Web Project in Java.

How It Works
Login Workflow

The user enters their credentials in index.jsp and submits the form.

The POST request is sent to LoginServlet.

LoginServlet retrieves the username and password parameters.

It validates the credentials.

On success: A new HttpSession is created, a "username" attribute is set, and the user is redirected to welcome.jsp.

On failure: An error attribute is set in the request, and the user is forwarded back to index.jsp to display the error message.

Logout Workflow

The logged-in user clicks the "Logout" button on welcome.jsp.

A POST request is sent to LogoutServlet.

LogoutServlet gets the current session and calls session.invalidate() to destroy it.

A logout confirmation message attribute is set in the request.

The user is redirected to index.jsp, where the confirmation message is displayed.
